UNRAVEL - A Decipherment Toolkit
http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/unravel/

## Dependencies

Additional scripts for installing dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/mnuhn/setupenv

Most importantly, you will need a patched version of openfst, such that it is
uses google-flags and google logging (compat.h). See above's repo for more
details.

Make sure that you have setup your environment properly, such that all
dependencies are met. Here are some variables that might play a role:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, CXX, CC, ...


## Installation
```
./autogen.sh
cd codec
make
cd ..
make
```

## Build Options
optional flags (e.g. ./configure --without-openmp):
* --without-openmp (when compiling with clang on mac, that doesn't have openmp support)
* --without-fix-ubuntu (when compoling on mac)

this e.g. works on my mac
```
./autogen.sh --without-openmp --without-fixubuntu
cd codec
make
cd ..
make
```

## Other
The code in the ./codec/ directory was written by Taro Watanabe.
He was so kind to allow us shipping this with UNRAVEL.

The code in the ./src/cdec/ directory was taken from the cdec decoder:
